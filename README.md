# Obstacle Avoidance
Implemented  'Obstacle Avoidance' steering behavior to avoid collisions using 'Circle vs OBB' algorithm. <br>

=> Provided a terrain composed of circles for the game entity to avoid.<br>
=> The game entity does a "reasonably good job" actually avoiding the obstacles.<br>
=> The entity wraps to the other side when it leaves the camera view.<br>
=> debug lines are used to visualize velocity vectors, collision detector box, and steering vectors.<br>
